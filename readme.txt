|  A Game by Jacob Miller, Zachary     |
|  Pickard and Owen Mechling           |
|                                      |
|  Developed as a final project for    |
|  DSU's CSC314 Assembly Lanugage      |
|  Class.                              |
|                                      |
|  The Labyrinth is a text-based       |
|  dungeon crawling adventure game.    |
|  The player is introduced to a       |
|  dark, overgrown and ominous maze    |
|  doomed to wander the twists and     |
|  turns fighting monsters, making     |
|  endgame altering decisions and      |
|  choosing between a path of mercy    |
|  or a path of destruction.           |
|                                      |
|   The game works via a main game     |
|  loop, various encouters, and        |
|  quite a few different subprograms   |
|  to handle battles, loss of health,  |
|  the tracking of stats like hubris,  |
|  and printing borders.               |
|                                      |
|  We feel that this project           |
|  demonstrates most of the assembly   |
|  language concepts and techniques    |
|  we learned throughout the           |
|  semester, presented in a fun and    |
|  approachable fashion.               |
|                                      |
|  Best of luck navigating your way    |
|  out of the seemingly endless        |
|  labyrinth......                     |
